              <span>Computer networks do not simply connect machines together, but run several
        applications on network devices, such as load balancers, intrusion detection
        systems, authentication portals, and more. Historically, these applications were
        black-boxes running on proprietary hardware, but software-defined networking
        (SDN) now allows anyone to write their own programs using open networking
        protocols (e.g., OpenFlow). So, what are the right abstractions for programming networks? This talk will try
        to address this question in three ways. <br />First, we present a syntactic theory of network forwarding called NetKAT, which supports equational reasoning about network-wide behavior. Using NetKAT, programmers can ask and answer questions like, "Can A communicate with B?",
        "Does all traffic traverse my intrusion detection system?", "Is there a loop in
        my network?", and so on. <br />Second, we present a fast and efficient compiler for NetKAT. Although several
        network compilers already exist, they are unusable on even moderately sized
        networks. Using new data structures and compilation algorithms, our new compiler
        is two orders of magnitudes faster than prior work and scales to large
        datacenter networks. <br />Finally, we consider the problem of building a reliable runtime system for
        NetKAT. NetKAT abstracts away several low-level details of networking hardware.
        Although this is a boon for the network programmer, the burden now shifts to us
        to engineer abstractions correctly. We present a Coq-certified runtime system
        that is proven correct with respect to a detailed operational model software-
        defined networks.

           Hop.js is a multitier extension of JavaScript. It allows a single
        JavaScript program to describe the client-side and the server-side
        components of a Web application. Its runtime environment ensures a
        consistent execution of the application on the server and on the
        client. This talk will shows its minimal set of JavaScript extensions
        that makes Web programming easier. It will present its runtime
        environment, with an emphasize on the handling of server-side
        parallelism.

         This talk is about scalloc, a fast, multicore-scalable, low-fragmentation memory allocator and selfie, a 4000-line implementation of a tiny self-compiling C compiler and a tiny self-executing MIPS emulator for teaching systems engineering. Scalloc is a typical example of a very complex, multi-year research effort while selfie is, at least for now, a purely educational, many-year effort in teaching compiler, operating system, and virtual machine design based on a single, highly principled software platform. So far scalloc and selfie only share the passion of their authors and are otherwise two distinct projects. Yet earlier versions of selfie, before they were even identified as such, were instrumental in bringing up the generation of students who did scalloc.
        The main ideas behind scalloc are: uniform treatment of small and big objects through so-called virtual spans, efficiently and effectively reclaiming free memory through fast and scalable global data structures, and constant-time (modulo synchronization) allocation and deallocation operations that trade off memory reuse and spatial locality without being subject to false sharing. The main ideas behind selfie are: a compiler written in and for a tiny subset of C called C* which uses the dereferencing * operator of C for memory access but lacks data structures and many other features and a MIPS emulator written in C* that can execute itself. Both are combined and extended by students to do very cool stuff.

		Memory corruption plagues systems since the dawn of computing. With the
rise of defense techniques like stack cookies, ASLR, and DEP, attacks
have become much more complicated, yet control-flow hijack attacks are
still prevalent. Attacks leverage code reuse attacks, often using some
form of information disclosure. Stronger defense mechanisms have been
proposed but none have seen wide deployment so far (i) due to the time
it takes to deploy a security mechanism, (ii) incompatibility with
specific features, and (iii) most severely due to performance overhead.
In the talk, we evaluate the security benefits and limitations of the
status quo and look into upcoming defense mechanisms (and their attacks).

Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) and Code-Pointer Integrity (CPI) are two of
the hottest upcoming defense mechanisms. CFI guarantees that the runtime
control flow follows the statically determined control-flow graph. An
attacker may reuse any of the valid transitions at any control flow
transfer. CPI on the other hand is a dynamic property that enforces
memory safety guarantees like bounds checks for code pointers by
separating code pointers from regular data. We will discuss differences
and advantages/disadvantages of both approaches, especially the security
benefits they give under novel attacks like Counterfeit Object-Oriented
Programming (COOP) and Control-Flow Bending (CFB).  COOP reuses complete
functions as gadgets and CFB bends the control flow along valid but
unintended paths in the control-flow graph of a program.

        ever-more powerful and sophisticated, and building tools to implement
        them is a time-consuming and difficult task. Writing a new verifier to
        validate each on-paper approach is impractical; for this reason
        intermediate verification languages such as Boogie and Why3 have become
        popular over the last decade. However, verification approaches geared
        around complex program logics (such as separation logic) have typically
        been implemented in specialised tools, since the reasoning is hard to
        map down to first-order automated reasoning. In practice, this means
        that a rich variety of modern techniques have no corresponding tool
        support.  In this talk, I will present the new Silver intermediate
        verification language, which has been designed to facilitate the
        lightweight implementation of a variety of modern methodologies for
        program verification. In contrast to lower-level verification languages,
        Silver provides native support for heap reasoning; modes of reasoning
        such as concurrent separation logic, dynamic frames and
        rely-guarantee/invariants can be simply encoded.  Silver has been
        developed as part of the Viper project, which provides two automated
        back-end verifiers for Silver programs. Since releasing our software in
        September last year, it has been used for (internal and external)
        projects to build tools for Java verification, non-blocking concurrency
        reasoning, flow-sensitive typing and reasoning about GPU and Linux
        kernel code.

        Alex Summers obtained his PhD from Imperial College
        London in 2009, in the area of type systems and
        classical logics. Since then he has worked in a
        variety of areas concerning software correctness and
        verification, at Imperial College London and ETH
        Zurich. His research interests include developing
        specification techniques for different (usually
        concurrent) programming paradigms, and implementing
        these in automatic verification tools. He was
        recently awarded the 2015 AITO Dahl-Nygaard Junior
        Prize for his work on type systems and the
        verification of object-oriented programs.

              <span>In this talk, I will first present a method and
        a tool TARA for generating succinct representations of sets of
        concurrent traces. In our work, we focus on trace sets that contain all
        correct or all incorrect permutations of events from a given trace. We
        represent such trace sets as Boolean combinations of happens-before
        ordering constraints between events.  Our trace set representations can
        drive diverse verification, fault localization, repair, and synthesis
        techniques for concurrent programs. In the remainder of the talk, I will
        focus on the use of our representation for synchronization synthesis.
        This work appears in POPL 2015 and CAV 2015, and is joint work with
        Pavol Cerny, Ed Clarke, Ashutosh Gupta, Tom Henzinger, Arjun
        Radhakrishna, Leonid Ryzhyk and Thorsten Tarrach.

              <h2>Programming Language Seminar, Junior</h2>
              <p>The junior PL seminar (<a href="http://lists.ccs.neu.edu/pipermail/pl-sem-jr">mailing list</a>) (<a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/stamourv/pljr.html">home page</a>): a regular student-only seminar, suitable for those new to the study of programming languages.
              <br>
              <p>The PL Seminar, Jr. is a seminar where students new to the area can discuss the study of programming languages. This seminar is not intended to replace the main PL Seminar, but we hope that it can augment that by providing a place where junior students can discuss topics and ask questions at a pace better suited to our level of knowledge. Topics include:
              <ul>
                <li>Design and analysis of programming languages: syntax, semantics, pragmatics (ie, how do you use a language feature in real programs?)</li>
                <li>Implementation of programming languages</li>
                <li>Program development, both large and small</li>
                <li>Programming pedagogy</li>
                <li>Programming tools and environments</li>
                <li>and anything else that catches our interest.</li>
              </ul>
              We will not restrict ourselves to current research. Indeed, we intend to focus on older papers, textbook chapters, and surveys.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h4>Why PL Seminar, Jr.?</h4>
              <small>
                <p>In many ways, the existing PL Seminar doesn't serve junior students well. For us, it is intended to provide an environment where we can go to listen to current research. While nobody expects us to understand the entire presentation, we would ideally be able to say, "I didn't understand that, but it sounded really neat." By and large, that hasn't happened, for a number of reasons:
                <ul>
                  <li>For many of us, once our level of comprehension drops below a certain threshold, we tend to get frustrated and tune out. It's very difficult to say that something sounds interesting when you don't even feel like you understand the language.</li>
                  <li>The discussion environment isn't really helpful to junior students. The questions from the audience are typically research-oriented; often, a great deal of background knowledge is required to follow the ensuing discussions.</li>
                  <li>To overuse a metaphor, the bandwidth available for discussion tends to be filled by a relatively small number of people; it's often difficult for a junior student to get a word in edgewise.</li>
                </ul>
                <p></small>
              <br>
              <h4>Seminar Culture</h4>

              <small><p>For this seminar to be as useful as possible, it is important we establish the right "seminar culture." This is, of course, something that is hard to describe, and it will shift and evolve. However, there are some guidelines for what we are trying to accomplish:
                <ul>
                  <li>Attendees are willing to learn and to help others learn. They should not come in order to demonstrate how much smarter they are than everyone else just because they know so much more about a specific topic.</li>
                  <li>Active listening is encouraged. Ask questions! In particular, while research questions are of course welcome, basic comprehension questions are especially encouraged. If you don't understand something, or if you don't believe a step in a proof, ask!</li>
                  <li>An important corollary: no question is too stupid to ask. This places an obligation on other members of the seminar: rather than express frustration at the basic nature of a question, look at it as an opportunity to practice your skills in explaining things.</li>
                  <li>Of course, while active listening is a good thing, we want to avoid having a few people fill the communications channel. So, please be considerate of the other people present and allow them to join the discussions as well.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Any attendee may propose a topic; we'll solicit volunteers to present a survey of the area. We expect that most of the presenters will be junior PL students, although outside presentations are welcome.</p></small>
